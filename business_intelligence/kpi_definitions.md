`Alerts Generated by Doctor / Total Prescriptions by Doctor`

**Purpose:**  
Evaluates prescribing safety per doctor.

---

##  Repeat High-Risk Patient Count
**Definition:**  
Number of patients with 2 or more Major alerts in 6 months.

**Purpose:**  
Identifies vulnerable patients needing closer monitoring.

---

##  Monthly Alert Trend
**Formula:**  
Count of alerts per month.
