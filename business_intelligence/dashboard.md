# Business Intelligence Dashboards
This document describes the three dashboards designed for the Medication Safety Checker BI environment.  
Each dashboard includes its purpose, key visualizations, and the insights it provides to support decision-making.

## 📊 Dashboard 1: Medication Interaction Overview

### **Purpose**
Provide management with a full overview of medication interaction activity, trends, and risk levels in the hospital.

### **Key Visualizations**
1. **Line Chart – Alerts Per Month**
   - Shows monthly trend of medication interaction alerts.
   - Helps detect spikes or improvements over time.

2. **Bar Chart – Alerts by Severity (Major/Moderate/Minor)**
   - Highlights the overall risk profile.
   - Allows quick identification of dangerous patterns.

3. **Table – Top Interacting Medicine Pairs**
   - Lists medicine pairs that most frequently cause alerts.
   - Helps pharmacists update guidelines and avoid high-risk combinations.

### **Insights Provided**
- Are interactions increasing or decreasing?
- Are major (dangerous) interactions common?
- Which medications create the highest risk?

## 👨‍⚕️ Dashboard 2: Doctor Performance & Risk

### **Purpose**
Evaluate prescribing safety for each doctor and identify areas where training or support is needed.

### **Key Visualizations**
1. **Column Chart – Alerts Per Doctor**
   - Shows number of alerts generated by each doctor.
   - Identifies doctors who prescribe risky combinations frequently.

2. **Pie Chart – Severity Breakdown Per Doctor**
   - Shows percentage of Major, Moderate, and Minor alerts per doctor.
   - Flags doctors with high rates of severe interactions.

3. **Ranked Table – Doctor Risk Score**
   - Combines total alerts and severity to rank doctors.
   - Helps determine who needs follow-up support or training.

### **Insights Provided**
- Which doctors need help with safer prescribing?
- Which doctors produce many high-severity alerts?
- Are training efforts reducing doctor risk levels?

## 🧑‍🦽 Dashboard 3: Patient Safety Dashboard

### **Purpose**
Identify high-risk patients who frequently experience dangerous interactions and require closer medical monitoring.

### **Key Visualizations**
1. **List – High-Risk Patients**
   - Shows patients with repeated Major interactions.
   - Useful for targeted follow-ups and clinical interventions.

2. **Line Chart – Patient Alerts Over Time**
   - Displays alert history for each patient.
   - Helps clinicians track patient safety trends.

3. **Risk Score Table**
   - Calculates risk score based on severity:
     - Major = 3 points
     - Moderate = 2 points
     - Minor = 1 point
   - Ranks patients by severity-weighted risk.

### **Insights Provided**
- Which patients need urgent review?
- Are specific patients repeatedly getting dangerous medications?
- Is the patient’s risk increasing or decreasing over time?
